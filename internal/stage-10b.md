# Stage 10b: Brand + Infra

## Goal

Shift the project to Geekist ownership and add release/documentation automation.

## Deliverables

- Rename package to `@geekist/llm-core`.
- Add CI with lint/typecheck/tests + Codecov.
- Add VitePress docs site and GitHub Pages deploy.
- Add release workflow (npm + GitHub release).
- Update README and repo metadata.

## Notes

- Docs live in `docs/` and are built by VitePress.
- Releases are tag-driven: `vX.Y.Z`.
